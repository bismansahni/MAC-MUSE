# Mac-RAG (GUI Edition)

This is the GUI version of Mac-RAG ‚Äî a fully on-device Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built for macOS using SwiftUI. It enables semantic search and local document-based question answering, all inside a modern macOS desktop app interface.

## Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI (macOS)**: Native GUI for interaction
- **CoreML**: Runs both MiniLM for embeddings and Mistral for generation
- **SQLite**: Stores chunk embeddings, metadata, and indexes
- **MiniLM (.mlpackage)**: Embedding model compiled for CoreML
- **Mistral 7B (Int4, CoreML)**: Quantized LLM for offline generation
- **FAISS**: For top-k vector similarity search

## What I Built

This macOS app lets you drop documents directly into the UI. A background service picks them up, splits them into character-based chunks, and embeds each chunk using MiniLM. These are stored with metadata in SQLite.

When a user asks a question, the query is embedded, compared against stored chunks using FAISS, and passed with the decoded context into Mistral 7B. All inference is done locally on the device ‚Äî no cloud, no APIs.

## How It Works

- Built a native macOS app with SwiftUI
- Implemented a background folder watcher to auto-index new documents
- Token-aware chunking using custom Swift logic
- MiniLM embeddings generated through CoreML
- Stored embeddings and metadata in SQLite
- Used FAISS for fast similarity search
- Query + top-k chunks passed to quantized Mistral model to generate answers

## Challenges

- Managing UI state updates while background tasks run
- Converting and optimizing MiniLM and Mistral models for CoreML
- Embedding/tokenizing alignment between models and Swift
- FAISS integration in a macOS-native context
- Ensuring everything works fully offline without Ollama or server dependencies

Still a work in progress ‚Äî planning to add multimodal support and deeper system-level integrations.
